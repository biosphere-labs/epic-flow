  Find what the decomposed tasks still miss now that the work is visible at
  the level of interfaces and units: the tasks that emerge, the seams nobody
  wired, the choices a builder would have to invent. Adds and fixes tasks,
  then reviews them with two blind reviewers. Fifth stage of Epic Flow. Use
  when the user wants a gap analysis, a gap review, a cross-model review of
  the tasks, or runs /epic-flow:gaps. Writes no product code.

# Epic Flow: Gaps

Read `conventions.md` in the plugin root, two levels up from this skill's base directory, before anything else.

Decompose brought the plan down to modules, interfaces and units. At that level new work shows up: wiring nobody listed, a migration, a config entry, an error path, a test. This stage finds it and adds it, so the build has nothing left to invent.

## Before you judge anything

Read the brief, the technical plan, every task, `questions.md`, the contract commit when there is one (`git show --stat <contract>` and the contract files), the repository's decision records, CLAUDE.md and memory. Open every path the tasks cite. A conclusion that contradicts any of these is wrong until you show otherwise.

## Checks

- **Coverage.** Every acceptance criterion maps to one or more task ids, and every example under it (`AC-n.m`) is a unit test in a task's **Check**. A criterion with no edge or failure example gets one, from the answer order.
- **Scope.** Every task maps to a section of the technical plan.
- **Paths.** Every cited path exists, or is a new path the contract commit, a producing task, or the layout around it supports.
- **Contracts.** With a contract commit: every seam two tasks share is frozen in it, a task builds against the declaration, never a prose description of another task's code, and every declaration has a doc comment that states its behaviour and agrees with the task that fills it. With `contract: none`: every seam two tasks share is written out as a signature in exactly one producing task, quoted identically in every task that uses it, and each user `depends_on` the producer.
- **Wiring.** Every new component has a caller and an entry point. Every new route, subscription, bean, command or job is registered where the framework looks for it. Every contract declaration, or every seam a task produces, has a task that implements it.
- **Self-contained.** Every task carries its content inline. None points to another document or task for what to build ("as in the base spec").
- **Choices left open.** No task leaves a builder to invent a name, a data shape, an error behaviour or a check.
- **Platform fit.** Data formats, transports and libraries match what the platform already uses. A different choice has a reason from this code in the technical plan.
- **People.** No task or step is assigned to a person.
- **Order.** No cycle in `depends_on`. Every input a task needs is a frozen contract, a task it depends on, or code that exists.

## Independent review

After the checks, review the task set twice. Neither review sees the other's findings until both are written. Use a different model for each when the harness allows.

- One asks what a builder would get wrong or have to invent.
- The other asks what the technical plan requires that no task delivers.

Keep them as `notes/gaps-review-a.md` and `notes/gaps-review-b.md`. Reconcile them: a finding that fails a check above is a gap; the rest are notes.

## What this stage may change

- Add a task for work that emerges at this level of detail. Trace it to the plan section and the criteria it serves.
- Fix a task's content: the change, the pattern to follow, the check.
- Add an acceptance criterion the technical plan already implies, numbered after the last one.
- Correct a path you verified by opening it.
- Add `builds_against` or `depends_on`.
- For a missing seam with a contract commit, run a small contract wave: add the declaration with its doc comment and contract test, pass decompose's gate for it, and commit it on the feature branch and update `contract:` in the technical plan. With `contract: none`, write the seam into its producing task and quote it in each user.

It may not change a decision in the brief or the technical plan, or the scope. It does no build work: no merges of other branches, no product code, no environment setup.

After the edits, run the checks again (not the reviews) and add one to `round`.

## When to block

Block only on:

- a question the answer order in the conventions does not settle, or one that belongs to the user, or
- a design decision the technical plan never made that the answer order cannot settle.

Write each one to `questions.md` as `open` first. Everything else is a gap you fix.

## Write the record

Write `.epic-flow/<slug>/gaps.md`:

```yaml
---
name: <slug>
verdict: clear
round: 1
---
```

`clear` means every check holds after the edits. `blocked` means a question above is still `open`.

- **Edits.** Each task file added or changed, and why.
- **Coverage.** Each criterion, then its task ids.
- **Wiring.** Each new component or registration, then the task that wires it and the entry point it is reached from.
- **Findings.** Each remaining review note: what is wrong, which file, what would resolve it.
- **Unresolved.** Empty when `clear`. Otherwise the open question ids.

Alone, stop and name `epic-flow:build`. Under the run, a `blocked` verdict returns `blocked`, and `status.md` is `waiting` with the question ids.

## Done when

- [ ] `gaps.md` exists with `verdict` `clear` or `blocked` and `round` of 1 or more.
- [ ] Coverage lists every AC in the technical plan, each with at least one task id that exists in `tasks/`.
- [ ] Every task has `criteria`, and every id in it is an AC in the technical plan.
- [ ] With a contract commit, every `builds_against` entry names a declaration present in it. With `contract: none`, every shared seam has one producing task, is quoted identically by each user, and each user `depends_on` the producer.
- [ ] Every `depends_on` id exists, and the ids form no cycle.
- [ ] Wiring names a task for each new component, route, subscription, bean, command or job the tasks add.
- [ ] No task points to another document for what to build, and none is assigned to a person.
- [ ] `notes/gaps-review-a.md` and `notes/gaps-review-b.md` exist.
- [ ] If `clear`, no question in `questions.md` is `open`. If `blocked`, every id under Unresolved is `open` in `questions.md`.
- [ ] `status.md` has a `gaps finished` or `gaps waiting` line.
